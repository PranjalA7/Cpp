Objectives :
    1) Concurrency: Ability to do context-switching between
    running tasks to achieve better performance (Concurrent execute)

    2) Parallelism: Doing more than one action AT THE SAME MOMENT IN TIME 
    BASED ON HARDWARE AVAILABILITY

    3) Learn about lock-based synchronization primitives
        1) MUTEX
        2) SEMAPHORE
        3) RECURSSIVE LOCKING
        4) CONDITIONAL LOCKING
        5) SCOPE_BASED LOCKING (BASED ON RAII PRINCIPLE)

    4) Algebraic data types in Modern c++
    


Regarding systems
1) Memory (primary memory or RAM)
2) Processing hardware unit (intel ya AMD)
