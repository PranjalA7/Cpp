Structured programming
    - C Programming 
    - imperaive coding 

 
 
Object Oriented Programming
    - represent state based on a model
    - extend, associate, compose, aggregate, generalize and abstract behaviour and types
    - It is suitable scal projects
 
 
//python code --->
create a list of numbers each called as num such that numbers is in the range of 1 to 10
 
    data = [num for num in range(1,11,1)]

1) Every Object has a type
    i) func also have type
    signature is its type

2) pass Objects to functions as parameters
    ii) func can be passed via wrapper or func
    pointer to other func

3) return Objects from functions
    iii) func can be returned via wrapper or function
    pointer from ohter functions

4) we can obtain address of Objects
    iv) we can obtain address of any func

5) Objects can be stored in containers
    v) func can also be stored in containers via wrapper or func pointer
